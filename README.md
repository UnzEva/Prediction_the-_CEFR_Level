# Prediction_the_CEFR_Level
## Project Description
Watching movies in the original language is a popular and effective method to get pumped when learning foreign languages. It is important to choose a film that suits the student's level of difficulty, so that the student understands 50-70% of the dialogues. 

CEFR stands for Common European Framework of Reference. It is the most trusted language ability measurement system in the world. It ranks students as beginner, intermediate and advanced. CEFR is also used to rank the difficulty of teaching materials like reading and listening.

Organisations like Cambridge, Oxford, British Council, etc. rely on CEFR to structure their teaching content.

## Goals

The idea of this project is to develop an ML solution to automatically determine the difficulty level of English-language movies. We will develop a classification for these films based on their difficulty level.
